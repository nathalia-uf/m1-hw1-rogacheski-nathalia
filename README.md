![](inside-out-sadness.gif)
## About Me ##
My name is Nathalia Rogachski, and I'm originally from Curitiba, Brazil. I have lived in six cities in my 23 years, continuously having to push my boundaries. I currently work for Disney in their Delivery Service sector at Disney Springs and within Magic Kingdom for Pandora Jewelry. During the pandemic, in May 2021, I graduated from the University of Central Florida with my bachelor's degree in Integrated Business. Like many, I did not have a defined path post-college and decided to funnel my education into Public Relations. I recently started my MA in the Summer of 2022, hoping for a brighter career path.
## Past Coding Experience ##
I have no past coding experience. Before the start of this class, I didn't even know a terminal existed. The photo representing me is not my personality but rather the stress of downloading all these new systems onto my computer.
## Career Goals ##
1. Land my first corporate role within the communications sector
2. Define excellence and receive a promotion to team leader
3. Receive a promotion to Senior Communication Analyst & building network
4. Establish a new venture becoming my own boss
